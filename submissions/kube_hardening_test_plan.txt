## Question
- How will you test the changes? 
- How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster? 

## Answer

In the working procedure, atleast there've three working environment as - development, staging and production. We'll test the changes in the development 
environment first and find the functionality & performance after hardening. As one of the hardening can affect of the others behavior of etcd, master and 
control plane. Then we'll monitor metrics that are available through observability and monitoring tools as - Prometheus and Grafana.

After having successfully tested these changes in the development environment, we'll migrate them to the Staging environment and simulate the actual 
user behavour & traffic. Once the test in the Staging environment is passing, we can take a blue-green deployment approach by supporting 2 production 
environments. The blue production environment is where the out-of-the box Kubernetes configuration resides while the green environment is where 
all the hardening changes will take place. At first, we'll send a small portion of the production traffic to the green environment and monitor any 
potential adverse effect. If everything goes well, we'll gradually increasing the traffic to the green environment. After migrating the full traffic, blue 
environment will become the backup environment or turned off completely.
